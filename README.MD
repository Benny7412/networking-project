# Overview

I created a simple TCP chat server that allows multiple clients to connect and communicate with eachother. I did this for the purpose of understanding how TCP and networking works and how to create a simple chat server.

# Network Communication

This is a simple client-server chat application.

The server uses TCP and defaults to 0.0.0.0(listen to all network connections) and port 5000
The client defaults to 127.0.0.1 and port 5000

# Development Environment

VSCode
Python [threading, socket, requests]

# Future Work

I would like to add more features such as private messaging, file transfer, and a GUI to learn how to create a more chat server.
